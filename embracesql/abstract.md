Chances are your application uses a database to store it's data.  There's also a pretty good chance it's a relational database.  If it's not a complete legacy system you probably are using an ORM as well.  That's all fine and good, and if it works for you great.  But Wait!  There are some places where taking advantage of SQL and the capabilities of your database may actually be a benefit over that ORM or CRUD like stored procedures you currently use.

This session will focus on SQL Server.  We'll look at various ORM scenarios, and if they would be better served using SQL.    We'll then move on to a common way stored procedures are built, and how we can make them better suited for our application, and still work within the confines of the database.  Lastly, we'll explore the JSON capabilities of SQL Server for both writing data, and more importantly reading and shaping data for our applications.

When you leave, you'll have the tools needed to embrace SQL when it's warranted, and not hate doing it.
