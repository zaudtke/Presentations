# Identifying and Designing Subsystems

We know how much time is spent on designing a UI, finding the right Architecture, and fighting/discussing the Tech Stack we're going to use for the Face of the application.  Yet, every web application I've worked on has had more than just a UI, API, and Database as part of the system.  There are subsystems that glue everything together.  These systems deal with queues, data transformations, company integrations, and more. They tend to only be noticed outside the dev team when they fail and still, sometimes you don't realize their need until it smacks you in the face. When the subsystem is an afterthought, we spend a fraction of the time designing them, and inevitably they become a problem down the road.

In this session, we’ll look at identifying these subsystems, and really digging into what their purpose is.  Once that is defined, things like lifetime, business components, tools, and patterns come into play.  I’ll show you examples of some not so good things I’ve seen (and written), and how to make them better.  You’ll leave this session knowing how to design your next subsystem without forcing undue problems on yourself in the future.
